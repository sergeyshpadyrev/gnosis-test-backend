# Gnosis Test Backend

This is a backend for home-take assignment for Gnosis.

## How to run locally

Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

Create `.env` file (because it's not a real app, I will just post the secret keys here):

```
BIN_ID=67c1f35fad19ca34f81427be
BIN_KEY=$2a$10$LPMiZqNcUk9GXO4fN/jeduGhDWjdtCPLWzZQ4uafQmoUXgOeW.Wl.
```

Run the app:

```bash
yarn dev
```
